# TournamentTracker

This is a tutorial I have followed from FreeCodeCamp.Com in which I create a complete application from start to finish, 

in order to further my understanding of the C# language with .NET

The application is made with .NET, and the Dapper ORM to communicate with server side database.

There are two alternative databases for this project: Microsoft SQL and text file data storage in CSV format.

The front end sections of the project are made with Winforms.

Other features of the application include a class library and custom events.

The application is a tournament tracker in which the user can create and moniter the results of sporting events.
